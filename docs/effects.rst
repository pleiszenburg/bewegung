Effects
=======

Effects can be applied to :ref:`layers <layer_tasks>` by decorating layer methods within :ref:`sequence classes <sequences>`. Layers can be combined with an arbitrary number of effects. From a functional point of view, effects post-process images generated by layer tasks. There is a set of readily available effects in ``bewegung``. However, new custom effects can be easily added as well.

Available Effects
-----------------

.. autoclass:: bewegung.FadeInEffect

.. autoclass:: bewegung.FadeOutEffect

Defining Custom Effects
-----------------------

Custom effects are implemented by deriving from :class:`bewegung.EffectBase`. Once derived, they can be directly applied to layers.
